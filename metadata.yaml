description: '"It is not the intention of this introduction to psychology to discuss
  the scientific or philosophical conceptions of psychology, or even to make a survey
  of the investigations and their results. What this little book attempts is rather
  to introduce the reader to the principal thoughts underlying present-day experimental
  psychology, leaving out many facts and methods which would be necessary for a thorough
  study of the subject. To omit all mention of experimental methods and their results
  is at the present day impossible. Yet we only need to consider a comparatively small
  number of results of the first importance in order to comprehend the basal principles
  of the new psychology. To characterise the methods of this psychology it would be
  impossible to omit all reference to experiments, but we can and will omit reference
  to the more or less complicated instruments on which the carrying out of such experiments
  depends"--Preface.'
